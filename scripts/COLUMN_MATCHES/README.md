## ‚öôÔ∏è Functionality

This script automates the comparison of two columns in a CSV file to identify **similar** and **unmatched** values:

1. **Load Data** ‚Äì Reads a CSV file and extracts values from two specified columns.  

2. **Fuzzy Matching** ‚Äì Uses `rapidfuzz` to calculate similarity scores between entries in both columns.  
   - Matches above a threshold (default: **50%**) are recorded.  
   - Unmatched values from both columns are flagged.  

3. **Export Results** ‚Äì Saves results to an Excel file with two sheets:  
   - **Matches** ‚Üí side-by-side matches with similarity percentages.  
   - **Unmatched** ‚Üí values that did not meet the similarity threshold.  

‚úÖ Output is an easy-to-read **Excel report** for quick inspection and further analysis.
